# AGPKeebo

The AGPKeebo is a 78 keys keyboard with a couple of unique features:

* General 65% layout with one extra key (language switch) on Row 5 (right-ALT and right-CTRL are U1)
* F1 - F10 keys in two separated columns
* 2x customizable knobs with push button function
* Each key contains two independent LEDs (1 north-facing and 1 south-facing LED)
* Additional independent LEDs for underglow
* 1x USB 2.0 Type C output for additional peripherals
* 1x SD Card reader

The main purpose of the two independent north- and south-facing LEDs was to allow highlighting certain keys for different language settings (e.g. highlight German "umlaute" such as ü or ö as side prints on the keys). However, this feature would require novel keycaps which do not exist yet. Making such keycaps are beyond the limitations of this project for now.

### PCB & Schematics

The PCB and the schematics were created using KiCad 6 and are available in the [pcb] folder.
