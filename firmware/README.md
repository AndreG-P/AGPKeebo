# AGPKeebo Firmware

The firmware of AGPKeebo is written with QMK and VIA. 

## Setup with VIA

In this folder you find the `via.json` which is necessary for VIA to detect AGPKeebo. In VIA (v3), switch to the design tab and load the JSON as the draft definition file. V2 should be disabled. Now the keyboard definition `AGP Keebo` should appear under `Shown Keyboard Definition` and you can use VIA to configure the keymaps.
